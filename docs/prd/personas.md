# Personas

## Investment Professional (PE Associate / VP / Principal)
- **Primary Use**: Portfolio diligence and pipeline triage.
- **Core Need**: Rapid, objective assessment to cut through founder narrative and consultant fluff.
- **What They Value**: Standardized scoring, investor-fit mapping, and defensible recommendations they can drop directly into IC memos or board decks.
- **Hidden Driver**: Fear of wasting cycles on a deal that will blow up in diligence; reputation risk if they bring bad deals upstairs.

## M&A Advisor / Business Consultant
- **Primary Use**: Client-facing tool to upgrade credibility and efficiency.
- **Core Need**: A repeatable framework that makes them look authoritative while compressing time-to-deliverable.
- **What They Value**: Branded, board-ready reports that feel like 40 hours of work but take 2.
- **Hidden Driver**: Pressure to differentiate from "commodity brokers" and justify fees in a crowded market.

## Company Founder / Executive Team
- **Primary Use**: Preparing the business for sale or outside investment.
- **Core Need**: A fast, affordable way to understand what buyers will attack â€” and fix it before it costs them leverage.
- **What They Value**: Prioritized fixes, investor comparison, and proof they can show their board or partners.
- **Hidden Driver**: Anxiety that one bad process mistake will erase years of work; distrust of outsiders but a quiet desire for control.
