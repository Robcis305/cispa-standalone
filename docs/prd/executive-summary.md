# Executive Summary

The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements and strategic direction for CIS Platform Assessment (CISPA), a new comprehensive transaction readiness assessment and advisory platform. The primary goal is to transform the traditional 40-50 hour assessment process into a streamlined 2-hour evaluation that provides not only scoring but prioritized recommendations and investor comparison capabilities, which will reduce assessment time by 95% while delivering actionable improvement plans and strategic investor selection guidance, enabling faster deal preparation and better transaction outcomes. 

The initial focus will be on the dynamic question selection system with core CISPA assessment (30 questions across 6 dimensions), optional assessment modules (Marketing, Technology, Human Capital and Investor), professional scoring with prioritized recommendations engine, and unique investor comparison tool that evaluates up to 5 investors side-by-side using weighted criteria, targeting investment professionals, M&A advisors, business consultants, and companies preparing for transactions to achieve a complete assessment and strategic advisory deliverable in under 2 hours with prioritized action plans and data-driven investor selection recommendations.
